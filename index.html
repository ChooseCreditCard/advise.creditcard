      <h2>What Counts as Credit-Card Advice?</h2>
      <p>Credit-card advice can mean many things: a blog post explaining how APR works, a video about rewards strategies, or a comparison site highlighting certain products. In practice, most content is a mix of education, opinion and commercial incentives.</p>
      <p>Good advice is transparent about what it is doing. It separates facts from opinions, marks sponsorships or affiliate links clearly, and avoids presenting general information as personalised financial recommendations.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How to Use Advice Without Treating It as Personal Guidance</h2>
      <p>Educational content is most helpful when you treat it as a lens, not a verdict. It can explain concepts, risk factors and trade-offs, but it cannot fully account for your income, obligations, local regulations or personal goals.</p>
      <p>A practical approach is to use neutral explanations to build your own checklist: what fees matter to you, which benefits you will realistically use, and what level of complexity you are comfortable managing month to month.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Signals of Neutral, Documentation-Based Content</h2>
      <p>Neutral credit-card information tends to lean heavily on issuer documentation, regulatory rules and clearly sourced definitions. It avoids promising outcomes or telling you which product you “must” get.</p>
      <p>Look for clear disclaimers, explanations of methodology and separation between educational sections and any commercial links or comparison tools.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Red Flags When Reading Card “Advice”</h2>
      <p>Some content is mainly designed to push specific cards. That is not automatically bad, but you should know when commercial incentives may shape what you are seeing.</p>
      <p>Be cautious when claims sound absolute (“always”, “never”), when risks are barely mentioned, or when ranking tables list only a small set of issuers without explaining how they were chosen.</p>
